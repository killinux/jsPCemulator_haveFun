  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;              I very lately discover this playgame ; but even after a year , googling does not bring in "good attempts" ,apart complains about<br />
                
                       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "not very useful" , "compiled kernel just brings in startLinux ..then black screen" ..etc....<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;            except one thread on <a href="http://www.bttr-software.de/forum/forum_entry.php?id=11293">DOS Ain't dead started by Arjay</a> this 21/3/2012 about runcom included in jspcemulator : and this excites me !            
</br ></br ></br ></br >

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          Let's just enumerate a few tentatives
            
                      <ol>
	<li>  linux-3.0.3 as kernel (this is just used in an earlier version of tinycore I am used to play with )</li>
	<li>  Get Pi with almost 10000 digits in less than a minute ( that's of course is Fabrice hpigot ! (DOSCOM as binfmt_misc)</li>
	<li>  Create a "drive not ready" in this virtual linux !!! with of course no hard drive around ! </li>
	<li>  make it run kamikaze-openwrt mipsel as if we were in front of a ...Linksys router ! (without any networking of course )</li>
</ol>    
                          
 <br />           
                          
                          
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Illustrations :<br /><br />

<br />hpigot_pseudoKamikaze_jspcemulator.png &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kamikaze-7.09_on_jsPcEmulator.png   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    tinycore_jsPcEmulator.png &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DriveNotReady_in_jsPcEmulator.png 
              
<br />

              <br /><br /> Before detailing howto for obtaining the above screenshots  ,let's specify the sources availability .<br /><br />
               
            jsPcEmulator was annouced around may 2011 ;I can't find thru google .Demo was probably accessible thru Bellard.org<br /><br />
            
            On 4 march 2012 <a href="http://git.busybox.net/busybox-website/snapshot/busybox-website-317871f1a85816e3c0f405f00b2f081978fa9caa.tar.bz2">live_bbox src</a> was put on busybox-website 
     This is a mere rootfs with busybox inside ,all mounted readonly ...so hard to do many things.<br /><br />
     
     But on Bellard site,a version of rootfs with gcc compiler included ,mounted readonly ,but with a /var on tmpfs allows already more fun.<br /><br />
 <br />   
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    In all cases  the game consists of :<br /><br /><ol>
	<li> jsInterpreter  comprising cpux86.js [cpux86-std.js cpux86-ta.js ]</li>
	<li> Linuxstarter   linuxstart.bin  jslinux.js</li>
	<li> utilities           term.js  utils.js</li>
	<li> linux         uncompressed kernel vmlinux   and an ext2 diskfile containing the rootfs</li>
</ol>
               
   <br />        
               
               

&nbsp;&nbsp;  By default the virtual memory allocated was limited to 16M . This probably limits the use of very big kernel , or implement qemu to emulate other cpu
  inside this virtual machine !!!!<br /><br /><br />
  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the site ,there is also a very small but useful 0tools.tag.gz to manipulate filedrive and the linuxstart-20120111.tar.gz where a patch for linux-2.6.20 was provided
 <br /> The patch allows "more flow" to serial 8250 needed by the virtual terminal ,and also creates a clipboard device for communication between the virtual machine and
  the browser (hence the pc host using many clic clic of the mouse !)
  
 <br /><br /><br /> 
     So it's very easy to adapt the patch for linux-3.0.3 :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  linux-3.0.3-jsPcEmulator.patch<br /><br />

     Increase the allocated memory to 128M  in jslinux.js<br /><br />
     
     Build a rootfs with standard glibc as available in ubuntu -we know better- so we could put there all cosmetics for fun ; In particular take advantage of
     builtin binfmt_misc to introduce there "mipsel"  operation under qemu-mipsel-static.<br /><br />
     
     Having fun with dummy file drive to make the emulator believes we had a bigger drive than what it really is ( I put in 0dummydrive to complement 0tools )
